DCC Club Recruitment Preparation. 
Time limit per test: 2 Seconds. 
Memory limit per test: 256 Megabytes. 
Problem Statement: 
The Developers & Coders Club (DCC) at NIT Agartala is hosting a recruitment drive for 
second-year students. In Round 2 of the recruitment process, students are given a limited 
amount of preparation time ‘p’ to complete the given tasks. The preparation involves ‘n’ 
tasks, each requiring a specific amount of time. Students want to start preparing from any 
task ‘i’ and continue with consecutive tasks until they either use up all their preparation time 
or complete all tasks. 
Given the number of tasks n and the total preparation time ‘p’ available, along with the time 
required for each task t1, t2, ..., tn, determine the maximum number of tasks a student can 
complete within their available preparation time. 
 Input: 
 
The first line contains two integers n and p (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^9) — the number 
of tasks and the total preparation time available. 
 
The second line contains a sequence of n integers t1, t2, ..., tn (1 ≤ ti ≤ 100), where ti is 
the time required for the i-th task. 
Output:  
 Print a single integer — the maximum number of tasks a student can complete.
